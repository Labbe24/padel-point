# Padel Point

This is a Vue webapplication for booking padel courts.

With this app the user must be able to
1. View all padel courts.
2. View available timeslots for each court.
3. Book a court.

The user should also be able to
1. Login to an account.
2. View history of booked courts.

It would be nice if an adminstrator could view
1. Relevant statistics.
